In an effort to exceed specifications:

Map interactivity: Added an InfoWindow to the Map Markers (mouseover and mouseout).

Restyled the page using Bootstrap tabs for navigation.

Artistic creativity: Restyled the appearance and added semantic tags throughout.

I tried to change the JS files as little as possible, mostly to add the semantic tags to the generated HTML.
